### I'm Shaun Evening, it's nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

I'm a seasoned **freelance software developer** and **Storybook maintainer** with a passion for creating engaging developer experiences. As a Developer Experience Engineer at Chromatic, I'm dedicated to improving integrations in the Storybook ecosystem, making it easier for developers to build high-quality UIs with confidence.

In addition to my technical expertise, I'm an advocate for education and empowering developers to reach their full potential. When I'm not coding, you can find me jamming on my bass or spending quality time with my Great Danes, Zola and Noodles.
